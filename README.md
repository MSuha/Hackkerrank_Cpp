I strongly recommend to read discussions at hackerrank and geeksforgeeks even you solved the problems.
There can be interesting and better approaches there.

I have imported some libraries which are not given by the site sometimes.

# Personal Notes:
  The inheritance section is disappointing. 
  
 - Virtual Functions
 - Abstract Classes
  - Polymorphism

    are absent from the category and virtual inheritance is never mentioned; however, it is vital to understand inheritance in C++.
  Also, the exercises are poor in this section.
